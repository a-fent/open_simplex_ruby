* OpenSimplex
This C extension for Ruby provides a fast way of producing consistent
noise using the OpenSimplex algorithm. Consistent noise is comprised of
random values at points across one or more dimensions, in which however
close points have close values. Depending on the specific noise
function, this produces the effect of ridges, gradients and the like.
Such distributions may be useful for procedural generation, for textures
in graphics, or anywhere where a reproducible random value for one or
more coordinates is needed.

OpenSimplex is a patent-unencumbered implementation of the Simplex
algorithm, which is itself an improved version of Perlin noise. Simplex
noise produces similar textures to Perlin noise, but is computationally
simpler and avoids some known artifacts that Perlin noise can produce.

Currently this library supports the following types of noise:
- Simplex noise in 1 to 4 dimensions;
- Simplex fractal (with specifiable octaves, gain and lacunarity)
- Ridged noise
- Worley noise
- Periodic (wrappable/tiling) versions of the above in 1 and 2 dimensions

* Installation
The library requires a working C++ compiler and [[https://github.com/g-truc/glm][GLM, the GL Mathematics library]]. GLM is a header-only library; on Debian-style Linux, for example, it can be installed with =apt install libglm-dev=.

#+begin_src sh
gem install open_simplex
#+end_src

* Usage
  The library currently offers only a module-function interface.

  =OpenSimplex::simplex(4)=

  A single value in one dimension. Simplex noise yields values in the range -1<x<1\

  =OpenSimplex::simplex(2.1, 8.3)=

  A single value from two dimensions.
